Go to your GitHub repo:

Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

Add two secrets:

Name: VITE_SUPABASE_URL → Value: https://something.supabase.co
Name: VITE_SUPABASE_KEY → Value: your anon key

That's it. The ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_URL }} in the workflow automatically pulls from there during build.

Also Make sure 

 GitHub Repo Settings → Pages -> Build and deployment Source is set to Github Actions (Not Deploy from a branch)
